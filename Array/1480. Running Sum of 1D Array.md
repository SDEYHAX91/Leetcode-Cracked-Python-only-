# Running Sum of 1d Array Solution(Optimal)

## Approach
1. Create a variable **sum = 0**.
2. In one iteration, the **sum** tracks the running total.
3. Each element in **nums** is updated in-place with the cumulative sum.
4. Ultimately, the **Running Sum** is generated in **nums**(nums array is modified).

## Complexity
Time complexity: O(n) (one iteration is enough)
Space complexity: O(1) (but that's not reflecting in LeaderboardğŸ˜”)

## Code:
'''python
class Solution:
    def runningSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        sum = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            sum += nums[i]
            nums[i] = sum
        return nums
