# Richest Customer Wealth 🚀

## 🧠 Problem Statement
You are given an `m x n` integer grid `accounts` where `accounts[i][j]` is the amount of money the **i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ customer** has in the **j​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ bank**. Return the wealth that the **richest customer** has.

A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.

## Examples:
**1.**

**Input:** accounts = `[[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]`

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:**

`1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6`

`2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6`

`Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.`



**2.**

**Input:** accounts = `[[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]`

**Output:** 10

**Explanation:** 

`1st customer has wealth = 6`

`2nd customer has wealth = 10`

`3rd customer has wealth = 8`

`The 2nd customer is the richest with a wealth of 10.`

## ✅ Approach

1. Initialize a variable `max_sum = 0`.
2. In one loop, for each iteration, sum of its iteration is compared with the maxsum.
3. If the sum of each iteration > `max_sum`, replace the `max_sum` with the sum.
4. Else, the iteration will continue.    
5. Ultimately, the `max_sum` will have maximum value.
6. Return `max_sum`.

## 🧮 Complexity

| Type              | Value     |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Time Complexity   | `O(n * m)`    |
| Space Complexity  | `O(1)`    |

## 🔍 Code (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumWealth(self, accounts: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        max_sum = 0
        for i in accounts:
            if max_sum < sum(i):
                max_sum = sum(i)
        return max_sum
```

## ✅ Approach - 2

Returns the maximum value from sum of each iteration in list comprehension.


## Code :

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumWealth(self, accounts):
            return max([sum(i) for i in accounts])
```

## 🧮 Complexity

| Time Complexity   | `O(n * m)`    |
| Space Complexity  | `O(n)`    |
