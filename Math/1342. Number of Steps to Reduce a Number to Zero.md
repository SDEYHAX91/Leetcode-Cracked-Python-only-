# Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero 🚀

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Given an integer `num`, return the number of steps to reduce it to **zero**.

In one step, if the current number is **even**, you have to divide it by 2, otherwise, you have to subtract 1 from it.

## Examples:
**1.**

**Input**: `num = 14`

**Output**: 6

**Explanation: **
`Step 1) 14 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 7.` 

`Step 2) 7 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 6.`

`Step 3) 6 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 3.` 

`Step 4) 3 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 2.` 

`Step 5) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1.`

`Step 6) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.`


**2.**
**Input:** `num = 8`

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** 

`Step 1) 8 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 4.`

`Step 2) 4 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 2.` 

`Step 3) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1.`

`Step 4) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.`

## ✅ Approach

1. Create a `while` loop that stops till `num = 0`.
2. Initialize a variable `i=0`.
3. If `num` is even, then divide it by 2.
4. If `num` is odd, subtract it from 1.
5. Outside the conditions, increment `i` by 1.
6. Return `i`.

## 🧮 Complexity

| Type              | Value     |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Time Complexity   | `O(n)`    |
| Space Complexity  | `O(1)`    |

## 🔍 Code (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfSteps(self, num: int) -> int:
        i = 0
        while num != 0:
            if num % 2 != 0:
                num -= 1
            else:
                num = num // 2
            i += 1
        return i
```
