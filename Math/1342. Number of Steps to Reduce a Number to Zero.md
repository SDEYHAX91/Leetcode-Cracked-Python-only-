# Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero 🚀

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Given an integer `num`, return the number of steps to reduce it to **zero**.

In one step, if the current number is **even**, you have to divide it by 2, otherwise, you have to subtract 1 from it.

## Examples:
**1.**

**Input**: `num = 14`

**Output**: 6

**Explanation: **
`Step 1) 14 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 7. 
Step 2) 7 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 6.
Step 3) 6 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 3. 
Step 4) 3 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 2. 
Step 5) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1. 
Step 6) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.`


**2.**
**Input:** nums = `[1,1,1,1,1]`

**Output:** `[1,2,3,4,5]`

**Explanation:** Running sum is obtained as follows: `[1, 1+1, 1+1+1, 1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1]`.

## ✅ Approach

1. Initialize a variable `sum = 0`.
2. Iterate through the array once.
3. At each index, add the current number to `sum`.
4. Replace the current element with the new `sum` (i.e., do it **in-place**).
5. Return the modified `nums` array.

## 🧮 Complexity

| Type              | Value     |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Time Complexity   | `O(n)`    |
| Space Complexity  | `O(1)`    |

⚠ Note:  
Even though this solution uses **O(1)** extra space and is **in-place**, LeetCode’s leaderboard may not reflect it due to:
- Memory reporting includes input/output arrays.
- Python interpreter overhead.
- Implementation-level optimizations in other languages.

## 🔍 Code (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def runningSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        sum = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            sum += nums[i]
            nums[i] = sum
        return nums
