## Fizz Buzz 🚀

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, return a string array `answer` **(1-indexed)** where:

`answer[i] == "FizzBuzz"` if i is **divisible by 3 and 5**.
`answer[i] == "Fizz"` if i is **divisible by 3**.
`answer[i] == "Buzz"` if i is **divisible by 5**.
`answer[i] == i` (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.

---

## Examples:

**Input:** `n = 3`

**Output:** `["1","2","Fizz"]`

Example 2:

Input: n = 5
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"]
Example 3:

Input: n = 15
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","FizzBuzz"]

✅ Approach
Initialize a variable sum = 0.
Iterate through the array once.
At each index, add the current number to sum.
Replace the current element with the new sum (i.e., do it in-place).
Return the modified nums array.
🧮 Complexity
Type	Value
Time Complexity	O(n)
Space Complexity	O(1)
⚠ Note:
Even though this solution uses O(1) extra space and is in-place, LeetCode’s leaderboard may not reflect it due to:

Memory reporting includes input/output arrays.
Python interpreter overhead.
Implementation-level optimizations in other languages.

        sum = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            sum += nums[i]
            nums[i] = sum
        return nums
