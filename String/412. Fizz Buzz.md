## Fizz Buzz üöÄ

## üß† Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, return a string array `answer` **(1-indexed)** where:

`answer[i] == "FizzBuzz"` if i is **divisible by 3 and 5**.

`answer[i] == "Fizz"` if i is **divisible by 3**.

`answer[i] == "Buzz"` if i is **divisible by 5**.

`answer[i] == i` (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.

## Examples:

1.

**Input:** `n = 3`

**Output:** `["1","2","Fizz"]`

2.

**Input:** `n = 5`
**Output:** `["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"]`

3.

**Input:** `n = 15`

**Output:** `["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","FizzBuzz"]`

## üîç Code (Python)
```python
class Solution:
    def fizzBuzz(self, n: int):
        x,y,z = 'Fizz','Buzz','FizzBuzz'
        answer = []
        for i in range(1,n+1):
            if i % 15 == 0:
                answer.append(z)
            elif i % 5 == 0:
                answer.append(y)
            elif i % 3 == 0:
                answer.append(x)
            else:
                answer.append(str(i))
        return answer
```
